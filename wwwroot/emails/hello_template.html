		Hello {user_name},</p>
	<p>
		I wanted to send you a note to say thanks and let you know that I'm the guy on the other side of the internet.
	</p>
	<p>
	I am one of the founders of MyPetAppointments, and it's very important to us that you have a great experience.
	</p>
	<p>
		Let me know if there is ever anything I can do to help.
	</p>
	<p>
	Enjoy, <br />
	Alex Novac
